# bl push

> Build and push a container image to the Blaxel registry without creating a
> deployment.

## Usage

```
Build and push a container image to the Blaxel registry without creating a deployment.

This command packages your code, uploads it, and builds a container image that
is stored in the workspace registry. Unlike 'bl deploy', this command does NOT
create or update any resource (agent, function, sandbox, or job).

The process includes:
1. Reading configuration from blaxel.toml
2. Packaging source code (respects .blaxelignore)
3. Uploading to Blaxel's build system via presigned URL
4. Building container image
5. Streaming build logs until the image is ready

If the blaxel.toml contains an 'image' field pointing to a registry image
(e.g. docker.io/myorg/myapp:latest), the platform will pull the image and
transform it for the target runtime via metamorph. If the same image was
already built, the build is triggered again by default. Use --skip-build to
skip the build if the image was already built.

For private registries, supply credentials via --registry-cred or --docker-config.

Usage:
  bl push [flags]

Examples:
  # Push current directory as an image
  bl push

  # Push with a custom name
  bl push --name my-image

  # Push a specific subdirectory
  bl push -d ./packages/my-agent

  # Push specifying a resource type
  bl push --type agent

  # Push from a private registry (credentials for blaxel.toml image field)
  bl push --registry-cred ghcr.io=user:token

  # Skip rebuild if image was already built
  bl push --skip-build

  # Push with a longer timeout for large images
  bl push --timeout 30m
