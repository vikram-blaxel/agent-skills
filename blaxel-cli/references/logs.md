# bl logs

> View logs for Blaxel resources.

## Usage

```
View logs for Blaxel resources.

The logs command displays logs for agents, jobs, sandboxes, and functions.
You must specify both the resource type and resource name.

Resource Types (with aliases):
- sandboxes (sandbox, sbx)
- jobs (job, j, jb)
- agents (agent, ag)
- functions (function, fn, mcp, mcps)

Sandbox Process Logs:
For sandboxes, you can view logs for a specific process by adding the process name:
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox my-process

Job Execution Logs:
For jobs, you can filter logs by execution ID and task ID:
  bl logs job my-job my-execution-id
  bl logs job my-job my-execution-id my-task-id

Time Filtering:
By default, logs from the last 1 hour are displayed.
In follow mode (--follow), the last 15 minutes are shown as context, then new logs
are continuously streamed in real-time.
You can customize this by:
- Using duration format (e.g., 3d, 1h, 10m, 24h) with --period flag
- Using explicit start/end times with --start and --end flags
- Maximum time range is 3 days

Duration units:
- d: days
- h: hours
- m: minutes
- s: seconds

Timestamps:
By default, logs are prefixed with their timestamp in local timezone.
Use --no-timestamps to hide them, or --utc to display timestamps in UTC.

Severity Filtering:
By default, all severity levels are shown. Use --severity to filter by specific levels.
Available severities: FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, UNKNOWN
Use comma-separated values: --severity ERROR,FATAL

Search:
Use --search to filter logs by text content. Only logs containing the search term will be displayed.

Examples:
  # View logs for a specific sandbox (last 1 hour - default)
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox

  # View logs for a specific process in a sandbox
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox my-process

  # Stream process logs in real-time
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox my-process --follow

  # View all logs for a job
  bl logs job my-job

  # View logs for a specific job execution
  bl logs job my-job exec-abc123

  # View logs for a specific task within an execution
  bl logs job my-job exec-abc123 task-456

  # Follow job execution logs in real-time
  bl logs job my-job exec-abc123 --follow

  # Follow logs in real-time (shows last 15 minutes, then streams new logs)
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox --follow

  # Follow logs with more historical context
  bl logs sandbox my-sandbox --follow --period 1h

  # View logs from last 3 days
  bl logs job my-job --period 3d

  # View logs for a specific time range
  bl logs agent my-agent --start 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z --end 2024-01-01T23:59:59Z

  # Hide timestamps in output
  bl logs agent my-agent --no-timestamps

  # Show timestamps in UTC
  bl logs agent my-agent --utc

  # Filter by severity
  bl logs agent my-agent --severity ERROR,FATAL

  # Search for specific text in logs
  bl logs agent my-agent --search "error"

  # Using aliases
  bl logs sbx my-sandbox --follow
  bl logs j my-job --period 1h
  bl logs fn my-function --follow
